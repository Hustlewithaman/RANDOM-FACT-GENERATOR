🎉 Project Showcase: Random Fact Generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API & DOM 🧠

I'm excited to share a small but powerful web project I recently built — a Random Fact Generator! This project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration with DOM manipulation to deliver a fun and interactive experience.

🔍 Project Overview:
The main idea is to display a random, interesting fact every time a user clicks a button. It fetches data from a public API and dynamically updates the content on the page — no reloads, just instant results!

💡 Key Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the webpage content

CSS: To style the layout with a clean and responsive design

JavaScript: To handle user interactions and asynchronous operations

API: I used the uselessfacts API to retrieve random facts

DOM Manipulation: To update the page content in real time based on API response

⚙ How it works:
When the user clicks the "Generate Fact" button, JavaScript makes a fetch() call to the API, receives a JSON response, and updates the DOM to display the new fact seamlessly.

📚 What I learned:

Handling asynchronous API requests with fetch

Parsing JSON and updating the DOM dynamically

Writing clean, modular JavaScript code

Creating a better UX with responsive design and smooth updates

🌐 This was a great hands-on project to practice real-world front-end development. It helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and how to work with APIs and the browser DOM.
